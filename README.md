# Responsive Portfolio

This is homework assignment #2 for the University of Richmond Full Stack Bootcamp.

For this project, my main goal was to create a responsive portfolio website utilizing **Bootstrap 4** along with **HTML5** and **CSS3**.

With the Bootstrap Grid System and a couple of media queries in my custom stylesheet, I was able to ensure that all of my content and images were 100% responsive across all screen sizes while maintaining a mobile-first approach.

# Validation

I ran all HTML files through the W3C Validation Service to ensure that my markup was error-free.  Semantic markup was used throughout, and all links are functional.
