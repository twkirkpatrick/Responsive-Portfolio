# Responsive-Portfolio

This is homework assignment #2 for the University of Richmond Full Stack Bootcamp.

For this project, my main goal was to create a responsive portfolio utilizing Bootstrap 4 along with HTML5 and CSS3.  

With the Bootstrap Grid System and a couple of media queries, I was able to ensure that all of my content and images were 100% responsive across all screen sizes while maintaining a mobile-first approach.
